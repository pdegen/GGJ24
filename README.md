## About

It's easy to steal eggs from chickens when you are a full-sized human. A little more difficult if you are mouse-sized, and the chicken are armed with bazookas!

This is the premise of our game! Enter the courtyard, steal the eggs and try to escape the increasing rage of the chickens. Survive a rainfall of bombs and collect as many eggs as possible!
